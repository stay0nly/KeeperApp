# KeeperApp

Each of us has memory problems - you can go to the store and forget to buy some product or completely forget about what you need to do tomorrow. 
Of course, you can write notes about important tasks in life in a notebook, or you can just use the online application and take notes there - 
it's more economical and simple, because you don't need to constantly buy new notebooks, carry extra paper and a pen with you.

## Usage
With this application, you can create and delete notes and add titles to them. All stylized for better UE and powered by React. 
In the future version I want to add a backend side, so you can authorize and store your own notes in the database.
